# BAE 565: GitHub Exercise

Steps:
1. Fork the repo to your NCSU GitHub account
2. Clone it to your computer using RStudio
3. Create a new branch (e.g. "tmp")
4. Update the code.Rmd as instructed
4. Knit the file as a github_document (note: you will have to edit the output line to be "output: github_document"). This will result in the knitted file being a markdown file (.md)
5. Commit your changes, including edits to code.Rmd and the new code.md file
6. Push the changes to GitHub. Push both the .Rmd file and the .md file.
7. Submit a pull request to merge the tmp branch with the master
